## Privacy

This app doesn't require any permission. There is NO data transferred to any server.
Therefore there is no information like "You are faster than ...% of all players."

## History

The sudoku app I played increased the advertising and consumed almost my whole data budget. 
So I decided to delete this app and to make my own sudoku app.
Once this is done, I would like to share this, that everybody may use it.
